# Helm Charts for deploying containerized applications to EKS Clusters with AWS App Mesh

This repository contains generic, parameterized Helm Charts suitable for deploying typical back-end web applications to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters that may have AWS App Mesh.

The reason while there are two Charts here is because development cycle of the application is likely to be much more rapid than frequency of changes made to the Canary chart.

[Application chart](./application/README.MD) will deploy the application to EKS cluster and it can be used with or without App Mesh present. When App Mesh features are turned off, this chart represents slight modification of a Helm Chart generated by Visual Studio [Kubernetes application template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/tutorial-kubernetes-tools?view=vs-2019#create-a-new-kubernetes-project).

[Canary chart](./canary/README.MD) is optional and requires App Mesh to be present on the cluster. Canary chart deploys App Mesh resources required to have a stable alias endpoint fronting multiple - usually two - application versions: current production version and new upgrade version.
