# Summary

Application chart has two modes driven by the "`appMesh.enabled`" [parameter](./chart/values.yaml):

- Without App Mesh, where it is very similar to the stock Helm Chart generated by Visual Studio Kubernetes project template.

- With App Mesh, where only the Deployment and Secrets parts of the regular Kubernetes installation remain, while App Mesh specific resources (VirtualNode, VirtualService and GatewayRoute) replace Service and Ingress. GatewayRoute is optional, just like regular Kubernetes Ingress, and is driven by the "`appMesh.outsideTrafficAllowed`" parameter.
