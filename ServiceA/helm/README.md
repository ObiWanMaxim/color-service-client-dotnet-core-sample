## Helm Charts for deploying containerized applications to Amazon EKS Clusters with (or without) AWS App Mesh

This repository contains generic, parameterized Helm Charts suitable for deploying typical back-end and front-end web applications to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters that *may be a part of an AWS App Mesh*. 

The main feature of this chart is that it was created for and tested with multiple (but not all) combinations of [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (required), and optional [AWS App Mesh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html), [Fargate (on EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html), [ALB Ingress Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html) and [Ingress Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-ingress-support-in-aws-app-mesh/).

This chart is application-agnostic, i.e. suitable for wide range of front-end and back-end web applications, and is compatible with Amazon Fargate EKS nodes, as well as regular EKS nodes. Although this chart is not a production-ready asset (no mTLS, for example), it is not a "Hello, World!" either. The chart is built with real-world applications (at the beginning of their development cycle) in mind, and is designed to be customized via parameters in the [values.yaml](./application/chart/values.yaml) file rather than modifying K8s manifest templates.

Another important feature is chart's ability to install applications in EKS namespaces regardless whether the namespace is part of an App Mesh or just a regular Kubernetes namespace.

The reason why there are two Charts here is because development cycle of the application is likely to be much more rapid than frequency of changes made to the Canary chart.

[Application chart](./application/README.MD) will deploy the application to an EKS cluster and it can be used with or without App Mesh present. When App Mesh features are turned off, this chart represents slight modification of a Helm Chart generated by Visual Studio [Kubernetes application template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/containers/tutorial-kubernetes-tools?view=vs-2019#create-a-new-kubernetes-project).

[Canary chart](./canary/README.MD) is optional and exists for creating a stable, alias endpoint fronting multiple - usually two - application versions: current production version and new upgrade version that needs to be verified before getting promoted to production.
